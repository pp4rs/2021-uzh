# Announcements

Important announcements will be posted here to avoid our inboxes getting clogged up.

If you have questions during the course - direct them to us via [Slack](https://pp4rs.slack.com). There's a 'Direct Message' feature so you can contact us individually as needed, but where possible post messages to a channel that all participants can see.
